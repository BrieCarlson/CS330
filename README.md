# How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My work on the project helped me get more comfortable with establishing the vertices and meshes while working with compound objects involving 2 primitives as well as adding multiple textures. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I would take examples of code from the master file tutorials and modify it in a way to meet my project goals. There was a lot of trial and error, finding what worked and what didn't. I would have to adjust the object and other preferences within the scene such as positions, colors, textures, lighting types.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This project helped my skills in reading through code and fixing it for my current needs of the application. It helped me work through the steps to get the code running and gave insight for how to save time while still producing quality code.

# How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I really focused on reusability while working on this scene. From week to week I would use the same code, just adding more elements to it for enhanced features as we learned more. When it came to the final project week, all I needed to do was implement sections of code to create new objects and everything else in the scene was already working well together. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a critical factor in the development of the app. I was utilizing it for my lights, meshes, and textures.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
With the initial development of the code, I was focusing on repetition to help me learn what each section was doing and how everything worked together. I would add parts to the milestone that corresponded to how I wanted the final project to look.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I could pin down the process of working a few lines and checking for errors with the help of computational graphics and visualizations. Due to my lack of experience in 3D Design, I had to take my time and break every step down. Once I have successfully used this for these tasks that I thought I would have difficulty completing, I will be able to use it for other functions in the future.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I may end up working in 3D graphics or rendering at some point, depending on what company or job I end up in. It will be easier for me to integrate the subjects into my future work projects now that I have a basic understanding of them.
